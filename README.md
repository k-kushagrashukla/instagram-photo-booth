## Built a Real-Time Instagram-Style Photo Booth with OpenCV + Python!

 - Harnessed the power of OpenCV and cvzone to create a live webcam application that detects faces and overlays fun filters like 👓 glasses, 🎩 hats, 🐶 dog faces, and even 🧛 vampire teeth — all in real-time!

## Tech Highlights:
✅Used FaceMesh & Face Detection modules for precise landmark tracking.

✅Applied PNG overlays smartly with accurate alignment (eyes, nose, chin).

✅Supports dynamic switching between multiple filters (keys 1–8).

✅Resized and placed filters using real facial proportions (no more mustache-on-neck bugs!).

- This project demonstrates how computer vision can be used to build fun, interactive, and engaging user experiences — a stepping stone toward augmented reality apps!
